# Grub Glide

Grub Glide is a Homebrew Gameboy game that I made using the GBDK C library for making Gameboy games. I'm not an expert in C, in fact this was my first time actually using it, so the code could probably be optimized better than how it is now.

If you want to compile this game yourself, all you'll need to do is install the GBDK library and add it to your `C:\` folder, then you should be able to run the `make.bat` file and build the GB file
