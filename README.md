# Grub Glide

Grub Glide is a Homebrew Gameboy game that I made using the GBDK C library for making Gameboy games. I'm not an expert in C, in fact this was my first time actually using it, so the code could probably be optimized better than how it is now.

If you would like to play this game without downloading the ROM, you can play the game within the browser using Homebrew Hub ([Game Link](https://gbhh.avivace.com/game/grub-glide)). While you're at it, check out some of the other games featured if you're interested in Homebrew Gameboy games.

Big thanks to @gingemonster for his tutorials on GBDK, without his videos I wouldn't have been able to get nearly as far into this project as I have, so big thanks to him.

If you want to compile this game yourself, all you'll need to do is install the GBDK library and add it to your `C:\` folder, then you should be able to run the `make.bat` file and build the GB file
